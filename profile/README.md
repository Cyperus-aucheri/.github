# Cyperus-aucheri
Hello! We are Cyperus aucheri, or just Aucheri!

We are made up of 3 college students doing a [T-Level](https://www.tlevels.gov.uk/students/subjects/digital-production-design-development) in college!

Between the 3 of us, we have a lot of knowledge!

# What do we do?
Whatever the college asks of us or whatever we want to! 

As of right now, we are at work placement and working to create code to tranfer WebForms authentication to [Blazor](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/aspnet/web-apps/blazor)!  

We are using a [reverse proxy](https://github.com/dotnet/yarp) with our own code, and it's nearly done!  

# Meet us all!
